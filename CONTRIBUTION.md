# Contribution

Before working on the project it's very important to understand its value and how it works. You can find that information in the project Documentation *(either in the README file or in the project Wiki)*. All CarambaLabs projects respect the [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/carambalabs/foundation). Keep it present when contributing with the project. If any of the principles listed there is not followed we'll be forced to take action on that.

## A note for developers

Are you interested in contributing? Just do it! CarambaLabs projects are also your projects. We created them for the community and you are part of that community. We're open to new contributors, proposals, improvements, bug fixes... If you are a very active contributor we'll also add you as a member of the repository. 

> We're looking forward to your contributions!

## Moderating

If you are moderator in any of our projects:

- When new Issues/PRs are opened we should check if they are in the scope of the project. In case they aren't we should politely explain why, suggesting alternatives, and clossing them.
- To have a better organization we should tag the Issues/PRs as they get created. Include a label for the type and the severity & occurence *(in case of a bug)*.
- If some information is required to have a better context about the Issue/PR we should ask the developer for it.
- If the Issue/PR doesn't follow the *Coe of Conduct*. We should close the Issue/PR right away. 

## Issuing

If you are a developer using the project and you are interested in reporting an issue:

- The issue body will be automatically filled with a template. Fill the template information describing your issue and providing some context.
- Project moderators might ask you for for some information. Be willing to report it.
- Use a descriptive name for the Issue.
- The reported Issue must follow the *Code of Conduct*.
